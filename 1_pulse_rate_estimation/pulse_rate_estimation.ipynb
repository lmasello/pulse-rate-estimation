    "The code below estimates pulse rates in beats per minutes (BPM) from a photoplethysmogram (PPG) taken from a wrist-wearable device. The code compares the frequencies of the PPG with the ones of a 3-axis accelerometer in order to compensate for the motion component. This is due to the arm movement while walking or running, where another periodic signal appears in the PPG due to this arm motion. Furthermore, the code takes into consideration only pulse rates bewteen 40 and 240 BPM.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code generates the pulse rate estimates along with a given confidence and error. Ground truth data from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals serve to compare the estimates and give the mean absolute errors.\n",

    "There are two main functions to run the code:\n",
    "- `RunPulseRateAlgorithm(data_fl, ref_fl)`: Runs the algorithm for a given sample by passing the sensor measurements file and the ground truth file.\n",

    "The algorithm uses the **Troika**[1] dataset. This dataset has the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Two-channel PPG signals\n",
    "- Three-axis ACC signals\n",
    "- One-channel ECG signals\n",
    "\n",
    "The measurements correspond to 12 samples of people in the range of 18 to 35 years old, sampled at 125 Hz. Both the PPG and ACC were recorded by a wristband and the ECG from the chest using ECG sensors. The measurements correspond to running activities on a treadmill with changing speeds.\n",

    "**Limitations:** \n",
    "- The dataset does not indicate fitness level, sex, ethnic, and dietary habits of the subjects. Furthremore, each activity has a limited sample duration.\n",

    "## Algorithm description\n",
    "### How the algoirhtm works\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the PPG and 3-axis ACC measurements are loaded, the algorithm finds the dominant frequencies of the PPG in windows of 8 seconds, with an overlap of 6 seconds. That is, it produces estimates every 2 seconds. The process of finding the dominant frequencies is where the top 5 PPG dominant frequencies are compared with the signals from the ACC. Starting with the frequency with the highest energy, if it is similar to dominant frequencies of the ACC (in any of the 3 axes), then it is skipped and the next dominant frequency is evaluated. If all the top frequencies of the PPG are similar to the ACC, then the frequency that resembles the previous two estimates is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "All signals pass by a Bandpass filter that keeps frequencies between 40 and 240 BPMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relevant physiology aspects\n",
    "The PPG signal was recorded from the wrist by two pulse oximeters with green LEDs (wavelength: 515nm). The PPG then measures the difference between the light emmited and reflected to estimate the pulse rate. This can be done since every time the ventricles contract, the capillaries in the wrist fill with blood. Then, the reflection of green light indicates how much blood there is in the capillaries. The periodic change in blood flow in these capillaries, are captured by the photodetector and gives an oscillating waveform with the estimated pulse rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm outputs\n",
    "The algorithm returns the confidence and estimation errors. The confidence is computed by taking the ration between the sum of the energy around the pulse rate estimate (with a window of 10 BPM) over the sum of the energy over the whole spectrum. The error is given by the absolute difference of the estimate and the ground truth signal in BPM.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Caveats on algorithm outputs\n",
    "There are several noise sources that are might influence the algorithm outputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Melanin: There exists different light absortion rates depending on the level of melanin. That results in different levels of confidence according to the skin color.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Arm motion: As the PPG signal measures pulse rate from blood flow, and this is a liquid, its flow is also influenced by the arm movement and not just by the heart's ventricles contraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Arm position: Similar to the previous point, the arm position determines how the blood flows. Thus, it influences how much light is reflected to the photodetector.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Finger movement: Finger movements generates movements in the arm tendons, which also might disturb the detection of light reflection. The reasons can be attributed to change in blood flow and a shift in the position of the sensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common failure modes\n",
    "The periodic signals detected by the accelerometer come from sensing arm motion. It is unlikely that they are due to the pulse rate. However, due to arm motion, sometimes its frequency is the same as the heart rate. This behaviour makes it difficult for the algorithm to differentiate the origin of the frequency. When it happens, the algorithm chooses the most similar frequency to the latest estimations. By doing so, the algorithm avoids peaks in the pulse estimates when there is a considerable uncertainty in the estimation."
