# Medical application of heart rate estimates
This section uses heart rate data to discover healthcare trends.

The project uses 24 hours of heart rate data from 1500 samples to try to validate the well-known trend that average resting heart rate increases up until middle age and then decreases into old age.

## Dataset
The data from this project comes from the [Cardiac Arrythmia Suppression Trial (CAST)](https://physionet.org/content/crisdb/1.0.0/), which was sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI). CAST collected 24 hours of heart rate data from ECGs from people who have had a myocardial infarction (MI) within the past two years.[1] This data has been smoothed and resampled to more closely resemble PPG-derived pulse rate data from a wrist wearable.[2]
